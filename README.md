📒 Contact Book (Python CLI Application)

🔸This project is a fully interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) Contact Book application built using Python. It allows users to perform essential contact management operations directly from the terminal, without the need for any graphical interface. Users can add new contacts by entering a name and phone number, search for specific contacts by name, display the entire list of saved contacts, edit existing entries, and delete contacts with confirmation. All contact data is stored in a Python dictionary during runtime, providing fast lookups and easy updates.
